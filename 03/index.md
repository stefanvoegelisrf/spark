## Douglas Engelbart

Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet pioneer¹. He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction¹. This resulted in the creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces¹. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968¹. Engelbart's law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him¹.
Douglas Engelbart's vision was to solve humanity's most important problems by harnessing our collective intelligence. He sought to augment human intellect and boost collective IQ, and his work has left a significant impact on the technological world¹.

### Augmenting the Human Intellect

Engelbart's "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework" represents a watershed document for modern computing and a vision for amplifying human life with technology⁴. The report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing new tools for advancing human intelligence within a digital era⁷. By "augmenting human intellect", Engelbart meant increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems⁴.

> Example: Digital technologies for physical, cognitive, mental, and perceptional augmentation; Wearable Computing and Ubiquitous Computing for augmenting human capabilities; Bionic systems for amplification and augmentation of human abilities; Exoskeletons and technologies for the amplification of human physical strength and; Physiological sensing for human augmentation, including Brain-Computer Interfaces; Implanted technologies and interfaces; Sensors and Actuators for Smart Artifacts and Smart Textiles; Sensing for Context-Awareness; Augmented Sport; Augmentation technologies for aspects of live; Augmentation of human health through digital technologies; Technologies to improve human experience and to reduce stress; Training and Rehabilitation Technology; Augmented and Mixed Reality; Applications in Tourism, Games, Art¹¹.

Engelbart's vision for augmenting human intellect was to increase our capability to approach complex problem situations, gain comprehension to suit our particular needs, and derive solutions to problems. His idea was to use computers to augment human intellect, allowing individuals and groups to work with more efficiency and productivity¹.

> Example: Imagine a group of scientists working on a complex problem. With Engelbart's augmentation, they could use a computer system to share data, collaboratively analyze the problem, and collectively come up with a solution. This system could include software for data analysis, a platform for group communication, and tools for creating and sharing documents¹.

### Open Hyperdocument System (OHS)

The Open Hyperdocument System (OHS) is a project developed by Engelbart aiming at building open source tools for collaborative knowledge management⁹. It is designed to manage and create knowledge across the Internet, allowing users to package and share information for collaborative work⁹. The first component of OHS is the Hyperscope, a browser-like tool that allows the user to access the features of the OHS⁹.

> Example: The first application will be the Hyperscope, an open source, web-browser-based tool that will allow users to view supported data formats using OHS features. For example, users will be able to apply different view specifications to e-mail archives using the Hyperscope⁷.

The Open Hyperdocument System (OHS) is an open-source project developed by Engelbart. It aims at building tools for collaborative knowledge management. The OHS is designed to manage and create knowledge across the Internet, allowing users to package and share information for collaborative work¹.

> Example: Consider a team working on a research project. They could use the OHS to create a shared workspace where they can store, organize, and annotate documents related to their research. Team members could add notes to these documents, link related documents together, and track changes over time¹.

### Bootstrapping

Engelbart coined the term "bootstrapping" to describe how whoever is working on developing and/or deploying new/improved tools and practices for boosting Collective IQ could use what they build to boost their own effectiveness¹². It's providers using what they provide to become faster, smarter, more effective providers¹². Bootstrapping is one of the key accelerators in Doug's powerful Bootstrapping Strategy for dramatically improving the way we work to solve important problems collectively¹².

> Example: Bootstrapping refers to starting and building a business utilizing personal finances or the organization’s operating revenue. The high dependence on personal savings and other internal sources of financing is the main feature of this concept. By bootstrapping a startup, entrepreneurs can refrain from raising funds via venture capitalists or angel investors. As a result, they can grow their business without giving up equity in the company. Entrepreneurs depend on sweat equity, personal savings, quick inventory turnover, a cash runway, and lean operations to become successful. For instance, bootstrapped companies may take preorders for their products. This enables them to utilize the funds generated from the orders to develop and deliver the items¹.

Engelbart coined the term "bootstrapping" to describe a strategy for systemic improvement. In this context, bootstrapping involves using the systems you are trying to improve as tools for their own improvement¹.

> Example: Suppose you are developing a new software tool. You could use an early version of this tool to manage the project, track bugs, and coordinate the team's work. As you use the tool, you would likely identify areas for improvement, which you could then address in subsequent versions¹.
