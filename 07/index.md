## Immersion

[Britta Neitzel - Facetten räumlicher Immersion in technischen Medien](facetten_raeumlicher_immersion_in_technischen_medien_-_britta_neitzel.pdf)

### Strategies for Being Drawn into the Screen

1. **Immersion and Telepresence:** The document discusses the concept of 'Immersion' as being transported to an elaborately simulated place, which is a strategy used by new media to draw the audience into the screen. This involves creating an experience where the boundary between the media space and the actual reception space in the consciousness of the recipients is partially erased or at least the attention from this boundary is diverted (Page 2).

2. **Interactive Media and Video Games:** Digital media, particularly video games, add to these strategies by allowing actions within the media spaces. This not only involves visual techniques but also interactive elements that engage the player, making them feel as if they are part of the media space (Page 9).

3. **Advertising and the Internet:** The document mentions how advertising uses the fascination of being able to be everywhere without leaving the house, a concept popularized by radio and live television, and now transferred to the internet. This strategy enhances the immersive aspect by creating the impression of unmediated experience and the ability to dive into any place in the world virtually (Page 1).

4. **Sensomotoric Connection:** New interface technologies that involve not just hand motor skills but the whole body, like the Nintendo Wii console, enhance the sensomotoric connection, further drawing the user into the screen (Page 12).

### Strategies for Emerging from the Screen

1. **Cinematographic Train Rides:** The document refers to the myth surrounding the screening of 'L'arrivée d'un train en gare à La Ciotat' where the locomotive seemed to rush towards the audience, creating a sensation of emerging from the screen (Page 4).

2. **Diffusion of Spaces:** The strategies discussed involve creating the impression that one is moving into the media space, that a media space extends into the material space, or that one is located at a third place. This is initially discussed in the context of analog media before considering the modifications and additions of these strategies in video games (Page 4).

### Strategies for Connecting Spaces

1. **Narrativization and Emotionalization:** Television uses strategies like narrativization and emotionalization to bind viewers, increase attention, and achieve immersive effects (Page 9).

2. **Parasocial Interaction:** A particular television strategy for the imaginary-immersive connection of the viewer space with the presented space is parasocial interaction, where presenters seemingly address the viewers directly, creating an illusion of real interaction (Page 9).

### Strategies for Generating a Third Space

1. **Involvement in Video Games:** The document suggests that in the context of video games, it is more appropriate to speak of involvement rather than immersion to emphasize the active element crucial for gameplay. This involvement creates a sense of being in a third space that is neither completely the player's physical space nor the game's virtual space (Page 12).

### Differentiating the Impact Levels

1. **Physiological Level:** The document describes how early film viewers experienced somatic empathy, feeling as if objects from the screen, like a train, were moving towards them (Page 5).

2. **Emotional and Intellectual Levels:** The strategies of narrativization and emotionalization are used to engage viewers on an emotional level, while the intellectual level is engaged through the content and interactive elements that require cognitive involvement (Page 9).

3. **Sensory Channels:**
   - **Visual:** The visual techniques of immersion are evident in the way media spaces are created and interacted with, such as in video games (Page 12).
   - **Acoustic:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts, acoustic elements often accompany visual stimuli to enhance the immersive experience.
   - **Other Senses:** The document does not provide specific strategies for olfactory, haptic, or kinesthetic channels in the excerpts provided, but these could be inferred as part of the overall sensory experience in immersive media.

The document does not explicitly mention strategies for olfactory, haptic, or kinesthetic channels, but these could be part of the broader discussion on immersive media experiences. The strategies mentioned are intertwined with the different levels of impact and sensory channels, creating a comprehensive approach to immersion in media.
