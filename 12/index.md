### Notes
Jill is mentioning that the current framing of AI is wrong. She describes it in a way that we are currently looking at it like magic. We don't see the inner working parts(blackboxes) of it and we're also fine with not knowing their secrets. Like we don't know how a magic trick is done, but we also know that it is not really possible and there has to be a trick behind it. She mentions that many people just believe these systems like ChatGPT and we should not do that and also educate properly.

She brings up the point, that there are a few magicians, that are doing the magic in the blackboxes.

She also advises to not make false promises like that the AI systems will solve all problems or that they are natural. Another point is also that we should be carefully looking at thought leaders, making these false promises and also look more closely at research on LLMs like GPT, as they can't define something as emergent or other any other claims, if they don't know what they have been trained on and how they have been trained.

When people are saying that we arrived in a society of superintelligence, she counters it with examples like weather forecasts, which already are super intelligence and have existed for decades which also have a reference to reality, wheres LLM are statistical monsters and contain randomness. An important point is that AI can't do a reality check as it is not able to look at the real word or experience it.

When solving problems, she explains, that humans are better at engineering solutions and we should not give up our agency to systems like GPT.

20 or more years ago, she worked on algorithms for AI systems but she noticed the lack of transparency and therefore switched sides.


#### Thoughts

#### Question: What does Jill mean by "AI is a magic tricks that eats up attention"
We don't see the inner working parts(blackboxes) of it and we're also fine with not knowing their secrets. Like we don't know how a magic trick is done, but we also know that it is not really possible and there has to be a trick behind it.

#### Question: What does Jill mean by "AI is like eating plastic"
She describes it in a way that if we use it too often, we get poisoned by the statistical monsters.

#### Question: What does Jill mean by "AI has a grounding problem"
We can't really describe how the systems work exactly and therefore can't really do studies on it as we can't understand the inner workings.
