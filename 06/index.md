## Tristan Harris - Our Brains Are No Match for Our Technology

The main point of the text is that we are living in an attention society. Meaning that content is produced to gain attention instead of being meaningful or helpful. This also results in algorithms that recommend content that gets the most attention. Therefore, such algorithms can be manipulated by posting content that focuses on drawing attention rather than creating meaningful discussion. Social media algorithms also tend to recommend content that you are likely to "like" or agree with and by that creating bubbles or rabbit holes that are hard to escape.
In the text, it is mentioned that these kinds of algorithms compromise our ability to take collective action. This is due to our inability to process that much information that we constantly get flooded with. 
However, the text also raises awareness that there are possibilities to change these structures and can create more humane technology. Specifically three actions are mentioned:

1. creating a tax for tech giants which force them to create platforms that privilege human values and are a service to the public.
2. Instead on relying on a free-model, using a paid-model service that does not make use of attention grabbing mechanisms rather it empowers us when doing offscreen stuff.
3. Strengthening content moderation to protect from malicious content

The text is also a call to raise our self-awareness and our critical thinking.
"The only way to make peace with technology is to make peace with ourselves"
